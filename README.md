The Big Five personality traits is a well known five-factor model and test used to group personality types. Using this dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/tunguz/big-five-personality-test?select=IPIP-FFM-data-8Nov2018) I plan to examine how personality types respond to the given questions, and if there is any correlation between their reported country and personality type.
