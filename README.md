The data was collected from over a million responses over a two year period. Users were prompted with 50 questions total, with subgroups of 10 corresponding to their respective traits. Users would rate from 1-5 how close the prompt matches their percieved personality. In addition users were timed in how long their answers took in milliseconds, and which country they said they live in.
